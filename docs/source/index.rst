Network Analysis
================

Network Analysis provides different tools for statistical network analysis. It is available for download on PyPI under the name `network-analysis` for Python 3. It is implemented in Python using different well-known packages such as NetworkX for the manipulations of graphs and Scipy for some optimizations or spatial operations.

Multiple statistics can be readily computed on any graphs, rather oriented or not. Also, a full of tools for exponential random graph models are available under the module `ergm` such as functions for simulating random graphs, computing the maximum likelihood estimator, getting the adjusted pseudolikelihood function, or even estimating the posterior density function from Gaussian estimation.
