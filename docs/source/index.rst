Network Analysis
================

Network Analysis provides a set of statistical tools to analyze networks. It can be seen as a complement `NetworkX <https://networkx.org/>`_, which provides the basic tools to create and manipulate networks.

It contains multiple modules that allow to easily compute some statistics such as the number of :math:`k`-stars or even the geometrically weighted degree, or to compute maximum likelihood estimators of exponential random graph models.
